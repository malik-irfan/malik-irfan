## Genesys Cloud CX Integration with Google Dialogflow
📆 2024

**What is it?**\
The integration of Google Cloud Dialogflow within Genesys Cloud enables the use of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to enhance inbound customer interactions. This solution allows customers to communicate naturally, helping the system better understand their intent and quickly route the interaction to a skilled agent when needed.

**How does it works?**\
Google Dialogflow, as a powerful Virtual Agent, is trained with specific data to recognize and understand customer intents during interactions. In this implementation, the Dialogflow bot is specifically trained to handle real estate-related queries, providing quick responses to common questions and tasks, such as property information, availability, and pricing. The system also includes a fallback mechanism that transfers the interaction to a live agent if the bot cannot resolve the query or if more complex assistance is needed.

Once integrated with Genesys Cloud, the Dialogflow bot is incorporated into the Architect call flows, allowing the system to call the bot when an inbound interaction occurs. This seamless integration ensures that customers can interact with the bot through a natural conversation, reducing the time needed to connect with agents while still offering the option for human assistance when necessary.


## Developed/Managed 30+ Reports & Dashboards (CUIC / Custom)
📆 2023-2024

I developed over 30 + reports and dashboards to meet the unique demands of contact center teams. These reports and dashboards were designed to help contact center managers and agents monitor performance metrics in real time, providing key insights into operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. By leveraging CUIC’s ability to fetch data from various Cisco contact center solutions, I tailored the reports and dashboards to meet specific business needs, ensuring they provide actionable insights for better decision-making.

The custom reports were designed to fetch and present data from the contact center’s underlying database, allowing managers to gain detailed insights into call volumes, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and wait times. I enabled the creation of custom queries to retrieve specific data sets, and also ensured that the reports could be easily customized to present relevant data to different stakeholders. This made the reports highly adaptable and accessible to various teams within the organization, from supervisors to top-level management, based on their role and requirements.

The dashboards I developed served as real-time visualization tools, consolidating key performance metrics into a user-friendly interface. These dashboards allowed both agents and managers to quickly assess performance, identify bottlenecks, and make real-time adjustments to improve the customer experience. With these custom dashboards and reports, contact center operations became more streamlined, enabling efficient monitoring of day-to-day activities and empowering teams to provide enhanced service and support.
