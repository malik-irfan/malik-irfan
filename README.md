## Genesys Cloud CX Integration with Google Dialogflow
üìÜ 2024

**What is it?**\
The integration of Google Cloud Dialogflow within Genesys Cloud enables the use of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to enhance inbound customer interactions. This solution allows customers to communicate naturally, helping the system better understand their intent and quickly route the interaction to a skilled agent when needed.

**How does it works?**\
Google Dialogflow, as a powerful Virtual Agent, is trained with specific data to recognize and understand customer intents during interactions. In this implementation, the Dialogflow bot is specifically trained to handle real estate-related queries, providing quick responses to common questions and tasks, such as property information, availability, and pricing. The system also includes a fallback mechanism that transfers the interaction to a live agent if the bot cannot resolve the query or if more complex assistance is needed.

Once integrated with Genesys Cloud, the Dialogflow bot is incorporated into the Architect call flows, allowing the system to call the bot when an inbound interaction occurs. This seamless integration ensures that customers can interact with the bot through a natural conversation, reducing the time needed to connect with agents while still offering the option for human assistance when necessary.


## Developed/Managed 30+ Reports & Dashboards (CUIC / Custom)
üìÜ 2023-2024

I developed over 30 + reports and dashboards to meet the unique demands of contact center teams. These reports and dashboards were designed to help contact center managers and agents monitor performance metrics in real time, providing key insights into operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. By leveraging CUIC‚Äôs ability to fetch data from various Cisco contact center solutions, I tailored the reports and dashboards to meet specific business needs, ensuring they provide actionable insights for better decision-making.

The custom reports were designed to fetch and present data from the contact center‚Äôs underlying database, allowing managers to gain detailed insights into call volumes, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and wait times. I enabled the creation of custom queries to retrieve specific data sets, and also ensured that the reports could be easily customized to present relevant data to different stakeholders. This made the reports highly adaptable and accessible to various teams within the organization, from supervisors to top-level management, based on their role and requirements.

The dashboards I developed served as real-time visualization tools, consolidating key performance metrics into a user-friendly interface. These dashboards allowed both agents and managers to quickly assess performance, identify bottlenecks, and make real-time adjustments to improve the customer experience. With these custom dashboards and reports, contact center operations became more streamlined, enabling efficient monitoring of day-to-day activities and empowering teams to provide enhanced service and support.



## 7+ IVR Applications (Telenor Pakistan)
üìÜ 2022

- Telenor Prepaid
- Telenor Postpaid
- Telenor Retailer
- Telenor UAN
- Telenor OB Offers
- Telenor OB VAS
- Telenor Smart Tune Active

**What are these helplines?**\
The Telenor helplines are a series of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems designed to streamline customer interactions and provide quick access to various services. They cover a range of customer needs, including prepaid and postpaid services, retailer support, UAN inquiries, and Value Added Services (VAS). These IVR helplines enable customers to resolve issues and access information without needing to speak to an agent, ensuring a faster, more efficient service experience.

**How does these works?**\
Each Telenor IVR helpline is tailored to handle specific customer queries, providing a self-service platform for tasks such as billing inquiries, package details, troubleshooting, and more. When a customer calls, the IVR system quickly guides them to the right option through an intuitive menu, eliminating the need to navigate long, complex menus. For instance, the Telenor Prepaid helpline enables users to manage their prepaid accounts, while the Postpaid and Retailer helplines serve different customer segments with specific queries.

These helplines are fully integrated with Telenor's backend CRM system, third-party solutions, and databases, ensuring that all customer interactions are handled smoothly and accurately. When needed, the system allows customers to connect with a live agent for further assistance. By automating routine processes and offering self-service options, these IVR systems reduce the need for manual intervention, improving efficiency and decreasing average handling time for customer service operations.

## JBOSS Connector (REST API-based Bridge)
üìÜ 2022



**What is it?**\
Jboss Connector is a REST API-based bridge that facilitates secure communication between Telenor's backend CRM systems, third-party software, and IVR applications. It exposes several APIs that simplify and secure data exchange between various backend systems and front-end IVR solutions.

**How does it works**\
Jboss Connector serves as the intermediary between Telenor‚Äôs IVR applications and its backend systems, allowing seamless communication through a secure REST API interface. When an IVR application requires access to data or services from the backend, it sends a request to the Jboss Connector, which securely handles the request and forwards it to the appropriate backend system. The two-way authentication mechanism ensures that the communication remains secure at all times, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

The Jboss Connector abstracts the complexities of the underlying backend systems by providing developers with easy-to-consume APIs, which allows them to focus on building custom solutions without needing to understand the details of the backend technologies. These APIs expose functionalities that can be utilized to integrate various services, such as CRM data retrieval or third-party application interaction, within the IVR workflows. This enhances the flexibility and scalability of the IVR system, making it easier to expand or modify its functionality as business needs evolve.

## SMPP Connector
üìÜ 2022

**What is it?**\
The SMPP Connector is a solution designed to enable short messaging functionality for applications using the SMPP protocol. It facilitates communication with SMS centers, SMS gateways, and SMPP gateways for sending SMS messages.

**How does it works?**\
The SMPP Connector uses the SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) protocol, an open industry standard, to establish communication between applications and Short Message Service Centers (SMSC). This connection allows applications to send and receive SMS messages efficiently by interacting with various messaging entities, including Routing Entities (RE) and Message Centers (MC). The connector enables seamless integration for functionalities such as sending One-Time Passwords (OTPs), billing details, and menu options to customers through SMS.

In the case of Telenor's IVR applications, the SMPP Connector is used to send critical information like OTPs and billing details to customers in real-time. The IVR applications are integrated with this connector, enabling them to deliver messages to customers directly through SMS, improving customer experience and service accessibility without requiring additional manual processes.

## PTCL Post Call Survey (IVR Application - Cisco) 
üìÜ 2018-2021

**What is it?**\
PTCL PCS: A Post-Call Survey Solution for Instant Customer Feedback.
Gathers Insights on Service Quality and Satisfaction for Continuous Improvement.

**How does it work?**\
PTCL PCS (Post Call Survey) works by collecting immediate feedback from customers after their interaction with support agents. Once the call ends, the system prompts the customer to participate in a brief survey, typically consisting of questions about service quality, agent helpfulness, and overall satisfaction. These questions are designed to gauge the customer‚Äôs experience and gather actionable insights that can drive service improvements.

The survey is seamlessly integrated with PTCL's CRM systems, ensuring that the feedback is linked directly to specific customer interactions. This integration allows for personalized insights, helping the company better understand customer needs and expectations. The primary goal of PTCL PCS is not only to measure customer satisfaction but also to identify areas for enhancement in service delivery, ultimately improving the overall customer experience.
